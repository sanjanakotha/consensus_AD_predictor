To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
2025-07-24 15:45:37.204719: I tensorflow/core/util/util.cc:169] oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.
